                        <hr>
                        <p>Senku is a slim and physically weak young man of average height with white (light green in the anime), brush-like hair that spikes up, two locks of hair that drape over his face, and sharp red eyes.

                            Senku's stone markings are two, symmetrical diagonal lines on top of his inner eyebrows.

                            Before petrification, Senku wore a typical school uniform with a lab coat over it. After waking up in the Stone World, he switched to wearing animal skin clothing in a rudimentary manner. After Yuzuriha's depetrification, these clothes patched up and are generally more presentable. He has Albert Einstein's mass–energy equivalence formula (E = mc2) written in his own blood across the breast of his shirt closer to his left shoulder.

                            During Minami's photoshoot with Senku for the hot air balloon launch event, Senku tried out modern outfits fashioned by Yuzuriha.

                            Following his revival in South America, he was given a dark cloak by Suika to wear over his outfit, a symbol of friendship. He retains his scars, with Senku speculating it was because of weathering. Later, he wears the village rope around his waist, hidden underneath his belt pouches.

                            After being revived in the rocket, Senku's petrification scars have healed</p>

                        <h2>Personality</h2>
                        <hr>
                        <p>Senku is a straight-forward, confident and highly logical individual who can come off as arrogant. Even so, Senku's borderline-overconfidence does not cloud his judgment, as he is often backed up by a vast underlying knowledge of science. Senku never belittles those who are less knowledgeable than him. Rather, he encourages and inspires everyone around him to do better. Because of his charisma and caring nature, people tend to gather around him, supporters and allies alike. At times when he is excited over a creation or at the discovery of something new, Senku can act over-the top, showing exaggerated emotions. Despite his usual appearance brimming with confidence and determination, Senku is not above berating himself if he does miss important information, such as when Kohaku pointed out that the north star did not align with north as he claimed. Senku had overlooked the earth's precession as he had not internalized the full effects of the many years that he was petrified. <br> Senku has a very logical mind, believing that there is nothing science cannot explain, even if it takes a long time to properly understand any one concept through science. <br><br> Although Senku has a strong sense of justice, he often bends the rules, withholds information, and manipulates others to get what he wants, but if only for the better of his allies. He often acts as if he builds inventions and uses people for his own interest, while actually creating for the betterment of others. Examples of this behavior include glasses for Suika and others, and the automobile for Ishigami Village's elderly. Beneath Senku's outward arrogance and manipulative actions lies a genuinely selfless and kind heart. This is proven time and time again, particularly when Senku mourns his adoptive father's death. During their decisive battle, Tsukasa notes that despite Senku's apparent cold rationale, his greatest weakness is his inability to abandon his friends, having witnessed his kindness firsthand with Yuzuriha taken hostage.<br><br> Unlike Taiju, Senku seems apathetic to the prospect of romance. He seemed annoyed when Kohaku worded her praise for him strangely, claiming she had "fallen for him". He strongly discouraged Nikki from developing any feelings towards him. He was also completely unaffected by Amaryllis' attempts to charm him, much to her chagrin. He believes a brain filled with love is most illogical, but he does support the romantic endeavors of his friends, such as Taiju's relationship with Yuzuriha, and Chrome's relationship with Ruri. <br> What Senku lacks in physical ability, he more than makes up for with his determination and persistence. He counted the time he was petrified to the last second for nearly 4 millennia and willingly faced death by Tsukasa's hand without being fazed, refusing to back down and sacrifice either Yuzuriha or the continued advancement of science for his own personal safety. Senku also defeats Ibara with his quick thinking and help from Ryusui Nanami. Senku is simply someone who refuses to give up on a task no matter how arduous.</p>

                    <article id="Abilities and Skills">
                        <h2>Abilities and Skills</h2>
                        <hr>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Genius Intelligence: Senku Ishigami is a genius with an encyclopedic knowledge of all things scientific. He is well versed in chemistry, physics, engineering, geology, biology and mathematics. Senku is able to easily create various useful tools and gadgets, medicine, and most notably, the de-petrification elixir, despite the limited materials of the Stone World. Tsukasa calls him "the sharpest, most intelligent man in the world". In addition to his scientific knowledge, Senku also possesses great resourcefulness and an analytical mind, seemingly never having a shortage of options at his disposal. For whatever he lacks, he has an ally who can offer their strength. He also possesses great mental fortitude, able to think quickly on his feet and keep his cool in the most dire of situations. Out of the current active characters, his mental assets are rivaled only by his former mentor, Dr. Xeno.
                            </li>
                            <li>Mental Resilience: While Senku lacks in physical ability, he more than makes up for with his determination and persistence. For example, he retained consciousness in his time of Petrification and counted the time he was petrified to the last second for nearly 4 millennia. Gen Asagiri found Senku to be an impressive person after he discovered Senku carved the date of his revival. He wondered how someone not only knew the day and year they were released, he stated he already respected Senku. When petrified again three years later, he was prepared and started counting to stay conscious.</li>
                            <li>Tactical Intelligence: In addition to his scientific intelligence, he appears to have some skill as a strategist. He managed to coordinate the villagers and even some of Tsukasa's army whom he converts to his side in an effective bloodless war against Tsukasa's Empire of Might. Similarly, he manages to have Kohaku, Ginro, and Amaryllis infiltrate the chief of Treasure Island's harem as spies, and manages to communicate with Kohaku and develop a strategy to cleverly gather the scattered petrified pieces of his friends, along with the precious stones from the Soyuz capsule.</li>
                            <li>Exceptional Memory: Senku remembers every compound and method of his inventions. He has rarely been wrong in the making of tools for the Kingdom of Science, and has an enormous amount of knowledge in the aforementioned science fields.
                            </li>
                            <li>Charisma: Though arrogant and eccentric, Senku seems to have a good understanding of people and how they think. He uses his many creations to charm those who were suspicious of him (like ramen, glasses, and medicine) to slowly warm up to him. Senku is also a capable leader, who is good with his words, able to motivate and lead the villagers into an effective army against Tsukasa's Empire of Might. He has personally gained the loyalty and respect of his allies (and enemies) through his hard work and determination.
                            </li>
                            <li>Linguistic Proficiency: Senku seems to be fluent in both Japanese and English. Initially, he had trouble with English as child but over time he became more proficient. He understood Ukyo and Gen's while they were speaking English through the buried phone in order to conceal their conversation from the others present. He was able to speak to understand the discussion between Taiju and Dr. Xeno with no problems. He understood and communicated with Dr. Brody with no problem.</li>
                            <li>Morse Code: Senku knows Morse code very well, using it to communicate with the cell phone team on the phone in order to ensnare Homura.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </article>

                    <article id="Weaknesses">
                        <h2>Weaknesses</h2>
                        <hr>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Incomplete knowledge: While Senku has an unbelievable amount of knowledge about science and technology, it should be noted that he does not know everything in as high detail as it may appear, rather, he seems to sometimes fill in the gaps with his well informed scientific thinking and experience. This however has in several occasions led him to struggle with problems he was not aware of, or things that he never knew how to do in detail. An example of this would be his making of stone tools. While he had the general idea of them and how to make them, he had to figure out the specific techniques out of trial and error. He also was unaware that carbon filaments don't work in vacuum tubes, and he mistakenly thought it would be practical to make the Steam Gorilla's engine with only one cylinder, which he ended up correcting.
                            </li>
                            <li>Low physical prowess: Senku is below average in terms of physical ability, lacking physical strength. He was unable to hold Homura, a petite woman shorter than 5 feet, after managing to grab hold of her. He also admits that he won't stand a chance against someone as strong as Kohaku in a fight (although it's not really a fair comparison, given her training and her status as a warrior). In a bonus chapter, Kohaku gives a small description on the physical abilities of the main characters. Senku is at the bottom at around 3 points, Chrome at 5, Ginro at 100, Kinro at 500, and Kohaku herself at 1000. Similarly, Senku has poor stamina, and tends to get physically exhausted rather quickly. He is also very vulnerable to hypothermia, only being able to withstand cold water for a short amount of time.
                            </li>
                            <li>Average craftsmanship: Senku's craftsmanship is good enough to make usable objects and tools, but in great part it took him a lot of work to get to that level. Even though Senku is aware of a vast range of crafting methods, many of them he never used before petrification (such as pottery, making stone tools or glassblowing), which leads him to have shortcomings because of his inexperience, and he improves greatly during the series, achieving practical skill levels on all the tasks just mentioned. Still his aspirations for the kindgom of science benefited greatly from having more experienced crafts people to build things more swiftly. Even though Kaseki was brought initially for the specific task of glassblowing, Senku still developed this skill himself, as shown when he made glassware after Suika revived him alone in the amazonian rainforest.
                            </li>
                            <li>Lack of cooking skills: While not a weakness per se, he is not an exceptional cook. He is shown to know how to cook, but lacks experience and quality ingredients. While he knows the process of how to make food, most of the time, the more complicated food does not taste good. While he was able to make cotton candy and cola, more complicated foods, such as wine, ramen, and bread prove to be terrible tasting. While in the ramen's case, part of it is due to not having the exact ingredients (he uses foxtail to make flour instead of wheat). When he tries to create bread with all of the proper ingredients on hand for the first time, it comes out so horrible that no modern person is capable of eating it (though the Ishigami Village tribe loves it because they have only ever eaten fish and have never tried bread before).
                            </li>
                            <li>Bad luck: Throughout the series, despite his high intelligence and ability to overcome obstacles, he tends to run into trouble often due to his horrific luck. Gen, at one point, quips to Senku (while they are trying to make gunpowder to stop Tsukasa's army and fail) that Senku always has crappy luck. In the Petrifaction arc, where he goes to Treasure Island, after all their resources and options have been exhausted as he and the Kingdom of Science are cornered by Ibara, Mozu, and their army, Senku is even forced to use his worst trump card: reviving Hyoga (a rather unpredictable and cruel man willing to manipulate and kill anyone who gets in his way) to have a fighting chance against Ibara and Mozu despite the strong possibility Hyoga will immediately overpower the Kingdom of Science and/or learn of the petrification device afterwards. Later on, Ibara uses the petrifaction device to petrify everyone but himself. When detailing travel by Vikings, a storm hits but they still reach America, due to Chrome. While commencing their exploration of United States, the crew is attacked by alligators as Gen once again makes a remark about how Senku's luck is non-existent and every one of his hypotheses about the worst-case scenario usually turn out to be true.
